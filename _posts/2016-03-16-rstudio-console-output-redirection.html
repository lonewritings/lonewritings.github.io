<p>In RStudio Console, most times we need to execute some commands a number of times for testing purposes. All though it serves the purpose of tracing a bug or refining the output, but still printing the output on the same console window makes it congested. To keep the console window clean, a R package "rite" creates a separate window for output. Moreover, you can move this window to another monitor as well. Although it provides various options, but for a minimal purpose you can start with this as</p>
<ol>
<li>Install package -   install.packages("rite")</li>
<li>Load the package</li>
<li>Start a separate window as - sinkstart ()</li>
<li>Stop  this window as - sinkstop()</li>
</ol>
