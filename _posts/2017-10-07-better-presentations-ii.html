<p>In this post, I will write about the TED talk by Mr. Richard Greene, author of the book, "<i>The Words that Shook the World: 100 Years of Unforgettable Speeches and Event</i>s".  In the talk, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0a61wFaF8A">The 7 secrets of the greatest speakers in history</a>", Richard first explains seven ingredients of a great talk, and then he shows video snippets of few great speakers including Loe Gehring, Winston Churchill, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, among others. Here, I will re-phrase only the seven ingredients of his talk in five bullet points</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Words, Voice tone, and Body language</strong>: Richard's experience/research shows that words, voice tone, and body language affect 7%, 38% and 55% of the audiences respectively. This means that uttering correct words/speech and neither having a variation (fast/slow according to condition) in voice tone nor using body language (looking, moving) will attract only 7% of the audience and the remaining will feel lost. Therefore to remain connected with the audience during the entire presentation, the presenter should ensure all three in appropriate proportions.</li>
<li><strong>Compelling Message</strong>: Ensure that your presentation has only one idea and try to plant the same idea in the audience.</li>
<li><b>Only Conversation</b>: Richard explains the difference between performance, presentation, and conversation. He further points out that a speaker often thinks his "talk" as a performance or a presentation. Thinking talk as "performance" is absurd because performance relates to acting and the talk is not acting, thinking talk as a "presentation" is not fully true because then you only think of the audience and not of yourself. Instead, talk is "conversation". In the words of Richard, "Talk/public speaking is nothing but a conversation from your heart about something that you are authentically passionate about. "</li>
<li><b>Four Languages of Communication</b>: Presenter should ensure that his(r) presentation has following four languages. (i) <i>Visual</i>: Show visual representation of as many concepts as possible (ii) <i>Auditory</i>: Summarize findings through stories (iii) <i>Auditory digital:</i>  Support findings with analytical and statistical measures/numbers (iv) <i>Kinesthetic</i>: Develop means of connecting with audience, i.e., audience should feel the message/idea</li>
<li><b>Authentic Passion</b>: This is the most important one among all the previously mentioned. The presenter must ensure that the message is worth to present.</li>
</ol>
