<p><strong>Probability Density Function (PDF)</strong>: This function gives the likelihood of a continuous random variable at a particular value. In the discrete cases, we call this by the name of probability mass function (<strong>PMF</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)</strong>: This function gives the accumulative probability of all the values less than or equal to a particular value. In other words, CDF gives accumulative probability from (negative)Â infinity to a said value.</p>
<p>Probability at a certain value is obtained by PDF or PMF depending on the case, while as probability of values less than <em>x </em>or probability between the range is obtained via CDF [1]. Basic R code to understand each of these functions is explained at <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/probability.html">this</a> link.</p>
