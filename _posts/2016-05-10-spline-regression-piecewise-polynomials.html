<p>Mostly, we have two ways to fit a regression line to our data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use single Linear/Non-Linear regression line to fit data</li>
<li>Fit more than one linear/non-linear regression lines to different parts of data. This is known as <strong>spline regression. </strong>We go for this because polynomials are not flexible enough to model all functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>First case is straightforward. In the second case, more than one linear/non-linear piecewise polynomial is fitted to data. These lines are connected at points known as "knots". This has certainly advantage as instead of fitting a single higher order polynomial to represent non-linearity in data, we use different low-order polynomials. This results in simplicity and also obeys the principle of parsimony (Occam's Razor), which is [1]</p>
<ol>
<li>models should have as few parameters as possible</li>
<li>linear models should be preferred to non-linear models</li>
<li>experiments relying on few assumptions should be preferred to those relying on many</li>
<li>models should be pared down until they are minimal adequate</li>
<li>simple explanations should be preferred to complex explanations

<p>The following figure [2] shows how two splines are added to data in different scenarios.</p>

<p>The only issue with this regression is  Knot selection, but with improved libraries this issue is handled easily. Some common terms include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Linear splines - Piecewise linear polynomials continous at knots. In cubic spline, it is piecewise cubic polynomils</li>
<li>Natural spline -  According to John, it is fancier version of cubic splines. It adds constraints at the boundary which helps in extrapolating function linearly beyond the boundary knots.</li>
</ol>
<p>With sayings of John, polynomials are more easy to think, but splines are much better behaved and more local.</p>
