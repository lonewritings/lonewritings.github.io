<p>At times we need to copy the Latex equations and tables in our presentation slides prepared either in Microsoft Powerpoint or Apple Keynote. There are many options to do the same but here I will explain a simple approach</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that LatexiT is already installed on your machine. If it is not installed download a fresh copy from <a href="https://www.chachatelier.fr/latexit/latexit-downloads.php?lang=en">this</a> link</li>
<li>Open LatexiT and copy the required latex equation/table from your latex file into the LatexiT editor. Make sure that you remove- begin{table}, begin{equation} type of commands. Â  After copying, click on LaTeX it button at bottom right to generate equations and tables</li>
<li>Once your equation/table is drawn, save the file using from File Menu.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are different options for customizing the output such as font size, installing new packages.</p>
