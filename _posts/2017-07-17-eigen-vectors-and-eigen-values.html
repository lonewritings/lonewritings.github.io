<p>A point <em>x</em> in a two-dimensional space represents a vector because it has a magnitude and a direction with respect to the center (0, 0). A scalar multiplication of <em>x</em> represents another vector which lies on the same line (elongated or scaled down) as that of vector <em>x</em>.  When we multiply vector <em>x</em> with a matrix <em>A</em>, it again results in a vector but now the resultant vector will be either in the same previous direction as that of <em>x</em> or in a new direction. Also, the resultant vector will get either scaled up or down. If the resultant vector lies in the same direction then we say vector <em>x</em> is Eigen vector of matrix <em>A</em>, otherwise, it is not an Eigen vector. A 96 seconds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXCRcnbCsJA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">youtube video</a> explains the same concept visually.</p>
<p>Corresponding to Eigen vector, we too get a scalar value ($latex \lambda$) which on multiplying vector <em>x</em> results in the same vector as that obtained by above matrix multiplication. Mathematically,</p>
<p>$latex A*x =   \lambda*x$</p>
<p>Here, $latex x$ refers to Eigen Vector and $latex \lambda$ refers  to Eigen value.</p>
