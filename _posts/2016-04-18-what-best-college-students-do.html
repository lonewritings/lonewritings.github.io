<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The title of this post is the name of a book written by Ken Bain. I heard about this book while attending the workshop on "Effective Teaching" by Dr. Pankaj Jalote at IIT-Delhi. </span><span class="s1">I read this book  cover to cover and here I note down the important points I found within the book. Each bullet point mentions different qualities of best students</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Goal oriented: Best students know what they want to do. Do you know?</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Deliberate Practice: To achieve mastery in any specialized field, best students involve themselves in deliberate practice sessions. This practice should be done with consistency</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Interconnections: Whenever you learn or see anything new, try to correlate it with the existing knowledge you have</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Growth Mindset: Always believe intelligence is not fixed, but it can be improved with effort</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Self-conversation: Always talk with yourself. Who am I? What am I doing here? Do I really making any difference or am I living someones’s else life</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Reflecting on experiences: Best learners not only use their experience but they reflect on their experiences, i.e., they ponder while observing the game</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Self-compassion: They are open and hence take responsibility of good or bad. They face failures, but they know this is a part and hence keep moving towards their goal</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mindfulness: Is a state of awareness. You see your problems clearly  and accept mental and social phenomenon.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Encouragement: Self-comfort, self-examination, and dedication.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Liberal arts: Do always different works/courses apart from your focused field. This always helps you to create connections and broaden the horizons</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Self-control, responsibility, deadlines</span></li>
</ul>
