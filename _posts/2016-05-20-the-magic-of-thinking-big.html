<p class="p1">I got a chance to read the book titled "The Magic of Thinking big" by David J. Schwartz. I started to read on 21 April 2016 and finished on 20 May 2016. I find this book helpful as it guides - how should we develop/improve our innate to the best. This book supports each claim with real-world examples. I believe it is impossible to contradict the author. While reading, I tried to note down some anecdotes and here I pen down the same for my revision. Each bullet heading refers to a different chapter title and sub-bullets are the anecdotes found in the respective chapter</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong><span class="s1">Belief</span></strong>
<ul>
<li class="li1">Believe in yourself that you can grow/improve with time if you put an effort</li>

</ul>
</li>

<ul class="ul2">

<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Avoid excusitis: Types - Health, Intelligence, age, luck. Don't give excuses of any of the mentioned types. Any of these excuses is just like a disease which starts because of small issue but it covers your entire body/life till death. Better avoid giving any excuse. Accept your fault at first hand. </span></li>
