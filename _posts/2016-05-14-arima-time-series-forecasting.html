<p>We use ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) to model time-series data for forecasting. ARIMA uses three basic concepts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Auto-Regressive</strong>: The term itself points to regression, i.e., it predicts new value using regression over the previous lagged values of the same series. The lags used define its order</li>
<li><strong>Integrated</strong>: This concept is used to remove trend (continuously increasing/decreasing time-series) from the time series. This is done by differencing consecutive values of time-series.</li>
<li><strong>Moving Average</strong>: In this we perform regression by using the error terms at various lags. The lags used define its order</li>
</ol>
<p>ARIMA works only on stationary data. If the input data is not stationary (detected via automated tests, i.e, different unit tests like famous Dickey-Fuller test), then stationary is achieved via differencing approach. The ARIMA forecasting equation for a stationary time-series is regression type equation in which predictors consist of previous response values at different lags. This also includes forecast errors at different lags.</p>

<p>Auto-regressive models and exponential smoothing are all special cases of ARIMA models</p>
