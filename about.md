Hi, 

My name is Haroon Rashid Lone. I am a Ph.D. student in the CSE department at IIIT Delhi, India.
My research revolves around Energy. [Richard Smalley], a Nobel laureate, mentions Energy as one of the [top-ten problems] of humanity for next 50 years. Within the energy domain, my work involves understanding electrical energy wastage instances inside buildings. The problem is studied actively in different fields but our approach rests on applying computer science techniques and tools. 
The cool thing about computer science is automation, intelligence, and speed. The problem is interesting given the varied buildings aesthetics, the range of appliances used, consumption hours, seasonal variations, comfort demand, etc. 

This blog lists technical topics, life experiences and whatever I think I should write.
